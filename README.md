# Clustering Algorithms and Cluster Validation Metrics in Machine Learning
This repository contains an exploration of various clustering algorithms and cluster validation metrics in machine learning. Clustering algorithms are a fundamental component of unsupervised learning, used to group similar data points together without prior knowledge of the groups. Cluster validation metrics provide quantitative measures to evaluate and validate the quality of clustering results.

# Clustering Algorithms
The repository covers the following clustering algorithms:

K-means: A popular algorithm that partitions a dataset into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between each data point and its closest centroid.

K-mode: A variant of k-means specifically designed for clustering categorical data, assigning a mode value to each cluster.

K-median: Similar to k-means, but minimizes the sum of absolute distances between data points and centroids.

K-medoids: Another variant of k-means that uses medoids as representative points for each cluster, minimizing the average distance to all other points in the cluster.

K-means++: An improvement over standard k-means that optimizes the initialization of centroids, leading to potentially better clustering results.

# Cluster Validation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of clustering techniques, various cluster validation metrics are explored, including:

Silhouette Coefficient: Measures how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster, considering both intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances.

Davies-Bouldin Index: Provides a measure of the average similarity between clusters, taking into account the distance between cluster centroids and the scatter within each cluster.
